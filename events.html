<!-- 
Now, the JavaScript code is contained inside a function. 
Note that the function is delimited by curly braces.
The function hello is never called inside the script element. 
Rather, there is a button element with the onclick attribute which has the hello function as its value. 

The clicking of a button is one events that JavaScript understands which can be used as a trigger. In this case, that trigger runs the hello function.
    Some other JavaScript events include:
    onmouseover : triggers when an element is hovered over
    onkeydown : triggers when a key is pressed
    onkeyup : triggers when a key is released
    onload : triggers when a page is loaded
    onblur : triggers when an object loses focus (when moving away from an input box, for example)
